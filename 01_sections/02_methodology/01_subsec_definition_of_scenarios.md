##Definition of Scenarios

First and foremost, the definition of test scenarios will be carried out. These will be designed using meaningful words and actions in the form of a flowchart. Then several JMeter scripts will be assembled to mimic these test scenarios and afterwards the JMeter scripts will be compared and measured against the test cases to make sure they comply completely with the test scenarios. This is achieved, usually, by carrying out a single-user/single-thread test to ensure that the required operation is isolated and successful. The recording of the browser network operations vs. the operations of the JMeter scripts will clarify if both sides are compliant with each other.
