##Stress Testing Considerations

When the upper-limits of system functionality(threshold between availability and consistent error) are obtained, extreme load will be placed on the application to determine it's point of absolute failure. These load metrics can only be obtained if previous load testing iterations were successful and all relevant data and indicators are accounted for. The stress test scenarios will also provide an accurate trend of how the system recuperates and returns to an acceptable operable state. The real-world goal of stress testing is to quantify the breaking points and address them before transitioning an application from development into production.
