# Introduction
The following report will highlight the design and implementation of a number of Black box tests performed on a Cloud Survey application deployed in Microsoft Azure. Black box testing (also called functional testing) is a method of testing that disregards the interior mechanisms of a system and concentrates on the outputs generated in response to selected inputs and execution conditions (Williams. 2008). The purpose of these tests is to measure the performance, quality and functionality of the aforementioned application. In addition, this paper will provide a system overview in which the Cloud Survey application will be detailed in its capabilityâ€™s and what Microsoft Azure provides in terms of testing the application. Moreover, methodologies and strategies will be discussed of how each test was planned and constructed to gather quality information and test results. A detailed and in depth analysis of the results generated by each test case will be presented and discussed to gauge how the application is performing. Furthermore, future work and concluding remarks will be detailed in this paper.
