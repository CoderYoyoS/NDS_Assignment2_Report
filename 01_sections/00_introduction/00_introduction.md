# Introduction

This study aims to deliver an accurate of overview of how a particular web application performs under load and stress. The application provided to test is called CloudSurvey and it is deployed to Microsoft's Azure platform. Traditional load and stress testing methodologies will be explored and suitable test cases will be designed in order to accurately monitor the aforementioned applications performance. Furthermore, this paper aims to clarify the results of these tests by outlining the applications load limitations in which it can handle concurrent users before a distinct trend in errors and also, bringing the application to its point of failure by use of a stress test which will highlight its absolute highest bounds of request handling capabilities. Furthermore, future work and concluding remarks will be detailed in this paper.
