#Further Work

In the event that the team had the opportunity to build on the work that was carried out in this study, several approaches would be taken differently:

- Establish early on what user interaction level is expected on an application such as this. Then an accurate assumption of load-testing thresholds can be established.

- Configure JMeter scripts early ensuring that consideration is given to deleting entities that have been created during test runs. A lot of time at the beginning of the project was lost due to manual deletion of surveys on the website.

- Stay critically aware of Azures quotas and implement a schedule to run tests so that these quotas stay within there limits(although this may still be an issues because of the 3 minute CPU time quota).
