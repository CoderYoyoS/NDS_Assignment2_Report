##Stress Tests Not Performed

Stress testing was not carried out without any of the preceeding test case scenarios for the following reasons:

- Test Case 1: would not have allowed for adequately stress testing because it had exceeded its CPU time quota whilst still performing its operations successfully. Furthermore, any subsequent increases in threads would have resulted in the exact same outcomes with anything higher than 700 users.

- Test Case 2: though it did not exceed its CPU time quota, would have exceeded it with a minimal increase of threads, therefore resulting in the application going offline and an inconclusive point of server failure.

- Test Case 3: same reasons as test case 2.
