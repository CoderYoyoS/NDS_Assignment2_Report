# Test Cases

This section will explore the test cases that have been devised in order to adequately load and stress test the CloudSurvey application. Each test case will simulate a particular user interaction that can be considered business-critical to the applications functionality. Furthermore, each test case will also demonstrate different types of requests. For example one user interaction may require a heavy download of assets such as stylesheets and Javascript source files whilst others will demonstrate operations that require requests that need to be made to the database server.
