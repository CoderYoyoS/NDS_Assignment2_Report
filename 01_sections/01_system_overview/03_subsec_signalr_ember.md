## SignalR and Ember.js

SignalR is a library intended for the ASP.NET framework. SignalR grants real-time web functionalities within a web application that allows server-side code to distribute data to the client instantaneously. This is done through the use of bi-directional communication between the client and web server.

Ember.js is a JavaScript web application framework that enforces the Model-View-View-Model (MVVM)  pattern. This pattern segregates the graphical user interface from the backend logic and data model. The concept of two-way data binding is highly supported within this framework, which in turn, provides synchronization between the view and the model. This means that if the user interface changes, then the model will change concurrently.
