## Ember.js

Ember.js is a JavaScript web application frameworks that enforces the Model-view-viewmodel (MVVC)  pattern. This pattern segregates the Graphical user interface from the backend logic and data model. The concept of two way data binding is highly supported within this framework, which in turn, provides synchronization between the view and the model. This means that if the user interface changes, then the model will change concurrently and vice versa.
